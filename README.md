# PolyMomentum

Single-strategy bot trading **"Up or Down" 5/15-min crypto candle markets on Polymarket**, written in Rust. Multi-exchange momentum signal → BS-binary fair-value mispricing → CLOB execution.

> **Status (2026-04-26):** Rust port complete. The Python implementation has been removed. Paper mode is production-ready and reaches 0.4-0.9 ms per cycle on a single binary. Live execution is wired through EIP-712 signed CLOB orders but gated behind `--i-understand-live`. Wallet ($6.03 USDC.e + ~5.37 POL) untouched throughout the port.

## What it does

For each active candle window:

1. **Subscribe** to Binance, Bybit, OKX (BTC) plus Binance/Bybit (ETH+SOL) spot WS feeds; pull Deribit IV every 60 s.
2. **Subscribe** to Polymarket's `/ws/market` book channel for every active candle's YES/NO tokens; resubscribe automatically when the contract scanner refreshes.
3. **Detect momentum** via `MomentumDetector`: z-score of the move from window-open against EWMA fast/slow realized vol, weighted with consistency + reversion penalty.
4. **Compute BS fair value** of the binary "above strike" using observed Deribit IV + window time-to-expiry.
5. **Decide** through `decide_candle_trade`: 4-zone gates (early / primary / late / terminal) with independent confidence/z/edge thresholds, dead-zone filter, entry-price EV gate, and an `edge_cap` brake against stale-data signals (relaxed in terminal zone).
6. **Hold to resolution**, mark won/lost vs our BTC tape, and cross-check against Polymarket's on-chain CTF resolution (UMA's optimistic oracle).

Zone gates split the window into bands with independent thresholds. The post-audit reality is that **only terminal-zone (last 5%) entries showed profit** in our backtests; the other zones are break-even or losing.

## Subcommands

```bash
polymomentum-engine live --mode paper           # main runtime (default)
polymomentum-engine preflight --mode paper      # startup/deploy checks
polymomentum-engine release-manifest --mode paper
polymomentum-engine live --mode live --i-understand-live   # real money; also requires VENUE/compliance env
polymomentum-engine scan                        # Gamma + scanner smoke test
polymomentum-engine wallet                      # USDC.e + POL balances
polymomentum-engine ctf <condition_id>          # on-chain CTF resolution read
polymomentum-engine validate-replay <session.jsonl>   # parity check
```

## Operational commands

```bash
# Health
ssh vps 'systemctl is-active polymomentum-engine adgts polyarbitrage'

# Live cycle log
ssh vps 'journalctl -u polymomentum-engine -f -n 5 | grep candle.cycle'

# Trade tape
ssh vps 'journalctl -u polymomentum-engine | grep -E "candle.trade|candle.resolved"'

# Kill switch (halts trading within ~100ms)
ssh vps 'touch /tmp/polymomentum/KILL'
# resume:
ssh vps 'rm /tmp/polymomentum/KILL && \
         sqlite3 /opt/polymomentum/logs/candle/state.db \
                 "DELETE FROM meta WHERE key=\"candle_breaker_tripped\"" && \
         systemctl restart polymomentum-engine'

# Deploy (build, ship, restart) — paper mode default
bash deploy/deploy.sh vps --enable-service --mode paper

# Live deployment is intentionally fail-closed. Do not sed the unit by hand:
# configure VENUE/OPERATOR_COUNTRY/compliance env first, then redeploy.
bash deploy/deploy.sh vps --enable-service --mode live --i-understand-live
```

## Replay-grade data collection

Paper-mode design goal: paper run logs replayable through the same decision function, with **identical PnL**, AND paper fills representative of live fills.

- **Per-evaluation JSONL** (`/opt/polymomentum/logs/sessions/session_*.jsonl`) — `cat=signal type=evaluation` events fire on every contract evaluation (trade or skip), with full state: open price, current price, z-score, confidence, EWMA fast/slow vol, cross-asset boost, top of book, decision zone, fair value, edge, traded flag, skip reason + detail.
- **CTF oracle cross-check** — `cat=oracle type=resolution` events compare our BTC-tape resolution to Polymarket's CCIX-driven settlement, read directly from the on-chain `ConditionalTokens` contract via `eth_call`.
- **Persistent state** — SQLite at `/opt/polymomentum/logs/candle/state.db` survives deploys; `paper_positions`, `oracle_pending`, `meta`, `trades`, `state` tables.

Validate a paper session against the decision function:

```bash
polymomentum-engine validate-replay /opt/polymomentum/logs/sessions/session_<ts>.jsonl
```

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = decision drift.

## Tests

```bash
cd rust_engine
cargo test                # 51 unit tests
cargo build --release     # ./target/release/polymomentum-engine
```

## Multibot etiquette

PolyMomentum shares the VPS (`193.24.234.202`, alias `vps`) with **adgts** (XRP/USDT futures grid, port 9092) and **polyarbitrage** (port 127.0.0.1:9090). Don't touch their `/opt/<name>`, `/etc/<name>`, or systemd units. Coexistence caps applied via `polymomentum-engine.service`: `Nice=5`, `CPUQuota=80%`, `MemoryMax=512M`, `TasksMax=256`, and read-only `/opt/shared` access for the live service. `deploy/deploy.sh --enable-service` checks peer service state before restarting PolyMomentum and refuses to restart while a peer unit is deactivating. Use `nice -n 10 cargo build --release` for builds on the VPS. See [docs/cross_bot_note_mexc_hardening.md](docs/cross_bot_note_mexc_hardening.md) for the cross-Claude coordination protocol.

## Strategy reality check

Post-audit (after fixing 4 lookahead/precision bugs in 2026-04-25): backtests showed **break-even to losing** across baseline, ewma_15min, regime variants. The terminal-zone-only sub-strategy had +$7.66 on 13 trades in one window — promising but tiny sample. **Going live with capital today would be premature.** The current play is to collect 24h+ of Rust paper data, then iterate before flipping any live switch.
